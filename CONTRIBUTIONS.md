## REPORT ON WHAT EACH TEAM MATE DID

### SE22UARI080:

- [Hinglish Auto-suggestion Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhuvanavijaya/nlp-autosuggestion)

- [Fine-tuning with Indic BERT](https://github.com/harshithamadarapu/Team16_Hinglish-Auto-suggestions/blob/main/FineTuneing(indic%20bert%20).ipynb)

- [Distill BERT Training](https://github.com/harshithamadarapu/Team16_Hinglish-Auto-suggestions/blob/main/distill%20bert(train)%20.ipynb)

1. **Preprocessing the Data**: Using regex, removed all the non-alphabets.

2. **Tokenization**: Tokenized the data using `split()` because, since it is auto-suggestion, I thought every word is important. But when it comes to training with BERT models, I used the model’s tokenizer, and for LSTM, I used normal tokenization.

3. **Training and Fine-Tuning the Model**: Even though there were failures, I experimented with several models like multilingual BERT too. However, the model was too heavy to execute fully. I worked with **Indic BERT** for fine-tuning.

4. **Word Embeddings and Context Embeddings**: Context embeddings were created with **LSTM**.

1.preprocessing the data : using regax removed all the non alphabets.

2.tokenization : tokenized the data using split() because since it is auto suggestion I thought every word is important. But when it comes to training with Bert models I used the model’s tokenizer and for LSTM I used to normal tokenization.

3.TRAINING AND FINETUNEING THE DATE: eventhough they are failures I experimented with not just these but several models like multilinguial bert too.but the model is too heavy to execute to the end. with indic bert,

4. WORD EMBEDDINGS AND CONTEXT EMBEDDINGS:
Context embeddings are created with LSTM.
